# Instagram Sharing Feature

## Overview

The Instagram Sharing feature allows users to share their travel journal memories directly to the official Island Connect Buddy Instagram page (@islandconnectbuddy). This creates a community-driven feed of authentic experiences from real travelers.

## How It Works

   - Optionally add your Instagram handle for credit
   - Submit for review

3. **Get Featured**
   - Our team reviews submissions
   - Selected photos are posted to @islandconnectbuddy
   - You get credited and tagged in the post
   - You receive a notification when featured
