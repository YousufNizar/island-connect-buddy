## Alert System

### Automatic Monitoring

The system runs background checks every 5 minutes:

2. Calculates expected check-out time
3. If 15+ minutes overdue:
   - Updates status to "overdue"
   - Creates safety alert
   - Notifies authorities (in production, via SMS/push)

### Manual Alerts

Tourists can trigger emergency alerts:
- SOS button in app
- Share location with authorities
- Contact emergency services

## Firestore Security Rules

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Location visits - tourists can read/write their own
    match /location_visits/{visitId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Safety alerts - authorities can read all
    match /safety_alerts/{alertId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
