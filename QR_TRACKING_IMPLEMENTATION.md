## üîÑ System Workflow

### Happy Path (Normal Visit)
```
1. Tourist arrives at location
2. Scans check-in QR code
3. Enters information (name, phone, duration)
4. System creates visit record
5. Tourist explores location
6. Tourist scans check-out QR code
7. System marks visit as completed
8. No alerts generated ‚úÖ
```

### Overdue Scenario (Safety Alert)
```
1. Tourist checks in (expected duration: 60 min)
2. Tourist explores location
3. Tourist forgets to check out
4. Time passes (60 + 15 grace = 75 minutes)
5. Background monitor detects overdue visit
6. System creates safety alert üö®
7. Alert appears in Safety Center
8. Authorities can take action
9. Authority contacts tourist
10. Tourist found safe
11. Authority marks alert as resolved ‚úÖ
```
