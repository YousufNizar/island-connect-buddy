### Current State: LOCAL STORAGE ONLY

### Next Steps for Production
To make reports persistent, you can:

2. **Use Firebase** (already configured in the app)
3. **Build a custom backend** (Node.js/Express)

---

## 🔥 Firebase Integration (Optional)

If you want to persist reports to Firebase:

### Update `handleAddReport` in `LeafletMap.tsx`:
```typescript
import { collection, addDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { db } from '@/config/firebase';

const handleAddReport = async (report: ScamReport) => {
  setUserReports([...userReports, report]);
  
  // Save to Firebase (if configured)
  if (db) {
    try {
      await addDoc(collection(db, 'scam-reports'), {
        ...report,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        status: 'pending'
      });
      alert('Report submitted and saved to database!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error saving report:', error);
      alert('Report submitted (saved locally only)');
    }
  } else {
    alert('Report submitted (saved locally only)');
  }
};
```

### Load Reports from Firebase:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!db) return;
  
  const loadReports = async () => {
    const reportsRef = collection(db, 'scam-reports');
    const snapshot = await getDocs(reportsRef);
    const reports = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      ...doc.data() as ScamReport,
      id: doc.id
    }));
    setUserReports(reports);
  };
  
  loadReports();
}, []);
```

## 🎓 How It Works (Technical)

### State Management
```typescript
const [showReportForm, setShowReportForm] = useState(false);
const [userReports, setUserReports] = useState<ScamReport[]>([]);
const [clickedPosition, setClickedPosition] = useState<...>(null);
```

### Report Submission Flow
1. User clicks "Report Scam" button
2. `setShowReportForm(true)` displays the modal
3. User fills out form and clicks "Submit"
4. `onSubmit` callback adds report to `userReports` state
5. useEffect re-renders map with new purple marker
6. Marker appears instantly with "Pending Verification" badge

### Marker Rendering
```typescript
// In useEffect
userReports.forEach((report) => {
  const marker = L.marker([...], { icon: userReportIcon })
    .addTo(map)
    .bindPopup(/* report details */);
});
```
